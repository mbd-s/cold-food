####Instructions


To run your own bot, start by cloning this repo and installing the dependencies:

 You'll need to get your own keys to connect to Twitter. Sign up for a new Twitter account and [register an app](https://dev.twitter.com/) for it. Click the "Keys and Access Tokens" tab and click "Generate Consumer Key and Secret." Note your Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token, and Access Token Secretâ€”you'll need to replace the placeholders in `config.js` with these. (Make sure to hide them if you're using GitHub.)
